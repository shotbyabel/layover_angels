#### User stories MVP

- As a user I need to see a home page so that I can register or log in.

- As a user I want to be able to find a knowledgable local and available members (aka Layover Angels ""LAs") that can help me complete time sensitive task during a **brief layover** at the airport.

- As a user I need to be able to select this Layover Angel based on their profile which needs to include, photo, car details, brief bio and positive references from past users

- As a user I would like to **filter** the Layover Angel profiles by gender, positive references and similar interest

- As a user I need to send them a personalized written request for assistance

- In my request form for the Layover Angel I need to have category boxes of exclusive requirements in order for the member to be 100% certain that they can meets all of them and they're able to fully help me.

- As a user I need to receive a reply with confirmation that my request was accepted by the Layover Angel with a detailed personal message.

-I would like to find Layover Angels in the most popular airports in the US not just in Los Angeles, CA
